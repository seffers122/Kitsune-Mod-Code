I use a git flow system so master is used for releases, develop for development etc. You can read more about it [here](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) or a quick cheatsheet [here](https://danielkummer.github.io/git-flow-cheatsheet/)

Basically if you want to submit a language patch, submit it against the develop branch. Read [here](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests#changing-the-branch-range-and-destination-repository) on how to change branches when submitting a PR
